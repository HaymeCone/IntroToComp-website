                <p> My name is James Ian M. Meneses from BSCS - 1A, I was absent when the groupings were conducted and now I am making this website myself at my spare time during the finals week. Had to learn HTML and CSS with some friends and eventually understood it. My favourite pokemon is Rayquaza thats why I made this type of website it has a cool design, dragon, and mega evolves. I found it fun making a website on my own because I get to put what I want and learn more </p>
